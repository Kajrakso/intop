\section{Table of Properties}

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{Table that shows which properties are
  preserved under different topological constructions.}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
  \hline
           & Connectedness & Path-connectedness & Compactness & Hausdorff &  \\ \hline
  Subspace &               &                    &             &   Yes     &  \\ \hline
  Quotient &               &                    &             &   No      &  \\ \hline
  Product  & Yes           &                    &   Yes       &   Yes     &  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

All the "No"s in table
has to be proven by a counter example.
